We first learned some [spend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVw3RrlP-sI) and [security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EMWBYVggQI) considerations such as how to set up roles and policies with the least privilege principle, using the root user as minimum as possible and creating an admin-roled user instead and best practices to avoid security breaches.

After that we created an [admin-roled user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdUnNuKylHg) for us to use instead of root user.

We created corresponding access keys for CLI usage and set it up in a gitpod container
